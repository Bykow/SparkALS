This region contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, which is similar to the hypoxia-responsive mRNA-stabilizing element of tyrosine hydroxylase. This study aimed to determine whether hypoxia affects insulin mRNA levels.Rat islets were incubated at normoxic or hypoxic conditions and with or without hydrogen peroxide and a nitric oxide donor. Insulin mRNA was determined by Northern hybridization. Islet homogenates were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay with an RNA-oligonucleotide, corresponding to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of rat insulin I mRNA. The expression of reporter gene mRNA, in islets transfected with reporter gene constructs containing the wild-type or mutated insulin mRNA pyrimidine-rich sequences, was measured by semiquantitive RT-PCR.Insulin mRNA was increased in response to hypoxia. This was paralleled by increased binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of insulin mRNA, which was counteracted by hydrogen peroxide. The reporter gene mRNA level containing the wild-type binding site was not increased in response to hypoxia, but mutation of the site resulted in a destabilization of the mRNA.The complete understanding of different diabetic conditions requires the elucidation of mechanisms that control insulin gene expression. Our data show that hypoxia may increase insulin mRNA levels by promoting the binding of PTB to the insulin mRNA 3'-UTR. Hydrogen peroxide abolishes the hypoxic effect indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species and/or the redox potential in the oxygen-signaling pathway.", "references": ["53e9a611b7602d9702f42159", "53e9b316b7602d9703ddd6aa", "53e9a689b7602d9702fbc829", "53e9bc21b7602d970488e3be", "53e9b7a5b7602d970434e2a8", "53e9a718b7602d970304d0cd", "53e9b4a0b7602d9703fa9916", "53e9a38fb7602d9702c9ed97", "53e9a298b7602d9702b9e65f"]}

The water and ethanol sorption and diffusion properties in the membrane loaded with different counter-ions, as well as the interactions between the solvent and the membrane ion pairs, were measured. The results show that the ion pairs are preferentially solvated by water, and the water content in the liquid mixture at which the ion pair is dissociated is much smaller for the potassium membrane than for the lithium membrane. The easier dissociation of the K carboxylate ion pair in the water-ethanol mixture explains the increase in the permeability according to the sequence Li+ < Na+ < K+. The apparent contradiction between the sulfonate and the carboxylate membranes with regards to the alkaline cation sequence according to which the permeability changes is explained by the difference in the ionization ability of the sulfonate and carboxylate ion pairs. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines.

Here, we present design and implementation features of a proposed system to be used for planning a bus travel. This problem is relevant to a large metropolitan city, like New Delhi, where local bus service forms the life-line of the city. There are about 10,000 city buses running on 814 routes on Delhi\u2019s roads. Often, there are many ways to reach a destination and often, commuters, even locals, do not possess knowledge about most of these alternate routes. Also, buses do not adhere to their schedules due to heavy traffic.Thus it becomes very difficult to remember every possible way to reach a destination (considering that one may have to break one\u2019s journey and take another route to reach the destination). Proposed BUSTRAP [1] solution aims at providing fairly accurate information about optimal way to reach a particular destination. Though we have implemented BUSTRAP as an SMS service, it can easily beadapted for other services like IVRS, WAP etc. stating one\u2019s current location and desired destination. The system will provide optimal ways to reach that place by bus \u2013 telling exact bus routes and numbers to board/change according to the bus movement on the city roads at that time. We record location of buses at a few instances on the roads through sensors. Our system finds their current location and speculates future locations based on these real time records. We identify changeover points on a route according to which a route plan would be formed.", "references": ["53e9a1c3b7602d9702abd999", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc"]}

An overview of immunity to Candidaincludes previous and recent data on innate and adaptive immune responses, focusing on recognition and sensing of Candidavia pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors, Dectin-1) and their role in directing the ensuing cascade of cytokine production, that leads to protective or non-protective immunity mediated by cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses. The disease Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC), which includes a subgroup of patients with the APECED syndrome (Autoimmune PolyEndocrinopathy Candidasis Ectodermal Dystrophy), where patients show a selective susceptibility to infections with Candida,is discussed in detail. The role of cell-mediated and humoral immunity in impaired protection against Candidais presented, as well as recent data demonstrating dysregulated cytokine production in response to Candida,which is suggested could be the underlying immune defect in these patients. The importance of CMC as a non-conventional primary immune deficiency, manifesting as narrow susceptibility to infection with weakly pathogenic microbes is stressed, given that these unique human \u201cmodels\u201d have the potential of hugely increasing our understanding of basic immune mechanisms involved in protection against Candidaand other fungi ", "references": ["53e9b145b7602d9703bc4bf2", "53e9ade2b7602d97037ed357", "53e9ac12b7602d97035d61d5", "53e9ad48b7602d970372ece9", "53e9b783b7602d970432a676", "53e999adb7602d97021f1cd6", "53e9ab97b7602d970353ecd7", "53e9ac4eb7602d970361a7a4", "53e9b281b7602d9703d2a5fc", "53e9a0e6b7602d97029d0f9c", "53e9b0b2b7602d9703b1c491", "53e9ada5b7602d97037a58f2", "53e9b0b7b7602d9703b2a08e", "53e9b290b7602d9703d37c2a", "53e9a1d0b7602d9702ac8bf3", "53e9a66eb7602d9702f9f15b", "53e9b82fb7602d97043ea15e", "53e9b634b7602d9704193518", "53e9b873b7602d9704440d6e", "53e9bd23b7602d97049b04c8", "53e9aebdb7602d97038e516f", "53e99abeb7602d970233f2dd", "53e9b565b7602d970409edf9", "53e9b5e6b7602d9704134c4c", "53e99808b7602d970201b90b", "53e9b5c2b7602d970410e685", "53e9ad4fb7602d9703734a56", "53e9bcbab7602d9704938708", "53e99e38b7602d97026fee78", "53e9a987b7602d97032e315a", "53e9bb6cb7602d97047ae341", "53e9b69eb7602d9704215779", "53e9ac43b7602d970361113a", "53e9ac28b7602d97035e8ed9", "53e9b815b7602d97043cd2ce", "53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc11b9", "53e9bc0ab7602d970486d078", "53e9a471b7602d9702d8c66e", "53e9bb4bb7602d970478ba53", "53e9a35fb7602d9702c6af6e", "53e99893b7602d97020caace", "53e9b661b7602d97041c0af9", "53e9ab2bb7602d97034b6a50", "53e999eeb7602d97022322cd", "53e9b403b7602d9703ef7479", "53e9ad18b7602d97036fc8b1", "53e99a91b7602d9702306555", "53e9baecb7602d970471bddc", "53e99fd0b7602d97028ad2f8", "53e9b8ccb7602d97044ac65d", "53e9a5e9b7602d9702f114cb", "53e9ac38b7602d97035fdbfa", "53e9bb02b7602d970473a833"]}
