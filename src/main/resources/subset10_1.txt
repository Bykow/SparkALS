The early literature in the field was dominated by a sociological approach with Polsby's classic article on the US House of Representatives leading the way. In the late 70s and 80s, the sociological approach was supplanted by \u2018new institutionalism\u2019 which took its cue from the work of Coase (1937) and Williamson (1985). Economic driven models of institutionalization feature self-interested actors who, although constrained, behave rationally both in creating and maintaining institutions. In contrast, sociological models view actors as important but not conscious of the effects of their choices; thus, at any point in time institutions are the result both of intended and unintended actions. March's (1981, 1985) work has revised the sociological approach and dominates the international relations and historical institutional literature while the economic tradition persists in main- stream American political science."}

The local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk isconsidered with sufficient spatial resolution: the region from outside the Hillsphere to the Jovian radius is covered by the nested-grid method. Toinvestigate the thermal effects of the circumplanetary disk, various equationsof state are adopted. Large thermal energy around the protoplanet slightlychanges the structure of the circumplanetary disk. Compared with a modeladopting an isothermal equation of state, in a model with an adiabatic equationof state, the protoplanet's gas envelope extends farther, and a slightly thickdisk appears near the protoplanet. However, different equations of state do notaffect the acquisition process of angular momentum for the protoplanetarysystem. Thus, the specific angular momentum acquired by the system is fitted asa function only of the protoplanet's mass. A large fraction of the totalangular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. Thedisk forms only in a compact region in very close proximity to the protoplanet.Adapting the results to the solar system, the proto-Jupiter and Saturn havecompact disks in the region of r < 21 r_J (r < 0.028 r_HJ) and r < 66 r_S (r <0.061 r_HS), respectively, where r_J (r_HJ) and r_S (r_HS) are the Jovian andSaturnian (Hill) radius, respectively. The surface density has a peak in theseregions due to the balance between centrifugal force and gravity of theprotoplanet. The size of these disks corresponds well to the outermost orbit ofregular satellites around Jupiter and Saturn. Regular satellites may form insuch compact disks around proto-gas giant planets.", "references": ["53e9a92ab7602d970327b2e2", "53e9a0b5b7602d970299e40a", "53e9ace9b7602d97036c7239", "53e9b648b7602d97041a305b", "53e9ba84b7602d97046a88fb", "53e99e38b7602d97026fd214", "53e9b4eeb7602d97040175fd", "53e9ab6eb7602d970350c125", "53e9ac9bb7602d97036784b0", "53e9a089b7602d9702971bd5", "53e9af67b7602d97039a7a1e", "53e9bd18b7602d97049a3621", "53e9a1d5b7602d9702acd915", "53e9a7ebb7602d970312e450", "53e99915b7602d970214d731", "53e9b23ab7602d9703cd8280", "53e998fcb7602d9702137ee6", "53e9a4b8b7602d9702dd6457", "53e9b008b7602d9703a612e8", "53e9a7ebb7602d970312e451", "53e9ab48b7602d97034db753", "53e9bd18b7602d97049a234c", "53e9a2b2b7602d9702bbbaee", "53e9ae05b7602d9703811bc3", "53e9bd6fb7602d9704a0ca1c"]}

The time-related and spatial characteristics of the cellular response were examined histomorphometrically using standardised sample fields under polarised-light microscopy. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear round cells were scarce in all follow-up groups. The occurrence of phagocytic cells (mononuclear macrophages and foreign-body giant cells) was highest in the PGA-fixed 12-week specimens. The giant cells seemed to adhere to the implant surface at an early stage, whereas the ultimate digestion and clearing of the decomposing polymeric material later on were performed by macrophages invading the implant body. No PGA was left in the 36-week specimens, while the gross geometry of the PLA screws was still intact at 48 weeks. In conclusion, the inflammatory response to these polymers was quite mild.
