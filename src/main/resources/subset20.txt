This region contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, which is similar to the hypoxia-responsive mRNA-stabilizing element of tyrosine hydroxylase. This study aimed to determine whether hypoxia affects insulin mRNA levels.Rat islets were incubated at normoxic or hypoxic conditions and with or without hydrogen peroxide and a nitric oxide donor. Insulin mRNA was determined by Northern hybridization. Islet homogenates were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay with an RNA-oligonucleotide, corresponding to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of rat insulin I mRNA. The expression of reporter gene mRNA, in islets transfected with reporter gene constructs containing the wild-type or mutated insulin mRNA pyrimidine-rich sequences, was measured by semiquantitive RT-PCR.Insulin mRNA was increased in response to hypoxia. This was paralleled by increased binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of insulin mRNA, which was counteracted by hydrogen peroxide. The reporter gene mRNA level containing the wild-type binding site was not increased in response to hypoxia, but mutation of the site resulted in a destabilization of the mRNA.The complete understanding of different diabetic conditions requires the elucidation of mechanisms that control insulin gene expression. Our data show that hypoxia may increase insulin mRNA levels by promoting the binding of PTB to the insulin mRNA 3'-UTR. Hydrogen peroxide abolishes the hypoxic effect indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species and/or the redox potential in the oxygen-signaling pathway.", "references": ["53e9a611b7602d9702f42159", "53e9b316b7602d9703ddd6aa", "53e9a689b7602d9702fbc829", "53e9bc21b7602d970488e3be", "53e9b7a5b7602d970434e2a8", "53e9a718b7602d970304d0cd", "53e9b4a0b7602d9703fa9916", "53e9a38fb7602d9702c9ed97", "53e9a298b7602d9702b9e65f"]}

The water and ethanol sorption and diffusion properties in the membrane loaded with different counter-ions, as well as the interactions between the solvent and the membrane ion pairs, were measured. The results show that the ion pairs are preferentially solvated by water, and the water content in the liquid mixture at which the ion pair is dissociated is much smaller for the potassium membrane than for the lithium membrane. The easier dissociation of the K carboxylate ion pair in the water-ethanol mixture explains the increase in the permeability according to the sequence Li+ < Na+ < K+. The apparent contradiction between the sulfonate and the carboxylate membranes with regards to the alkaline cation sequence according to which the permeability changes is explained by the difference in the ionization ability of the sulfonate and carboxylate ion pairs. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines.

Here, we present design and implementation features of a proposed system to be used for planning a bus travel. This problem is relevant to a large metropolitan city, like New Delhi, where local bus service forms the life-line of the city. There are about 10,000 city buses running on 814 routes on Delhi\u2019s roads. Often, there are many ways to reach a destination and often, commuters, even locals, do not possess knowledge about most of these alternate routes. Also, buses do not adhere to their schedules due to heavy traffic.Thus it becomes very difficult to remember every possible way to reach a destination (considering that one may have to break one\u2019s journey and take another route to reach the destination). Proposed BUSTRAP [1] solution aims at providing fairly accurate information about optimal way to reach a particular destination. Though we have implemented BUSTRAP as an SMS service, it can easily beadapted for other services like IVRS, WAP etc. stating one\u2019s current location and desired destination. The system will provide optimal ways to reach that place by bus \u2013 telling exact bus routes and numbers to board/change according to the bus movement on the city roads at that time. We record location of buses at a few instances on the roads through sensors. Our system finds their current location and speculates future locations based on these real time records. We identify changeover points on a route according to which a route plan would be formed.", "references": ["53e9a1c3b7602d9702abd999", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc"]}

An overview of immunity to Candidaincludes previous and recent data on innate and adaptive immune responses, focusing on recognition and sensing of Candidavia pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors, Dectin-1) and their role in directing the ensuing cascade of cytokine production, that leads to protective or non-protective immunity mediated by cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses. The disease Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC), which includes a subgroup of patients with the APECED syndrome (Autoimmune PolyEndocrinopathy Candidasis Ectodermal Dystrophy), where patients show a selective susceptibility to infections with Candida,is discussed in detail. The role of cell-mediated and humoral immunity in impaired protection against Candidais presented, as well as recent data demonstrating dysregulated cytokine production in response to Candida,which is suggested could be the underlying immune defect in these patients. The importance of CMC as a non-conventional primary immune deficiency, manifesting as narrow susceptibility to infection with weakly pathogenic microbes is stressed, given that these unique human \u201cmodels\u201d have the potential of hugely increasing our understanding of basic immune mechanisms involved in protection against Candidaand other fungi ", "references": ["53e9b145b7602d9703bc4bf2", "53e9ade2b7602d97037ed357", "53e9ac12b7602d97035d61d5", "53e9ad48b7602d970372ece9", "53e9b783b7602d970432a676", "53e999adb7602d97021f1cd6", "53e9ab97b7602d970353ecd7", "53e9ac4eb7602d970361a7a4", "53e9b281b7602d9703d2a5fc", "53e9a0e6b7602d97029d0f9c", "53e9b0b2b7602d9703b1c491", "53e9ada5b7602d97037a58f2", "53e9b0b7b7602d9703b2a08e", "53e9b290b7602d9703d37c2a", "53e9a1d0b7602d9702ac8bf3", "53e9a66eb7602d9702f9f15b", "53e9b82fb7602d97043ea15e", "53e9b634b7602d9704193518", "53e9b873b7602d9704440d6e", "53e9bd23b7602d97049b04c8", "53e9aebdb7602d97038e516f", "53e99abeb7602d970233f2dd", "53e9b565b7602d970409edf9", "53e9b5e6b7602d9704134c4c", "53e99808b7602d970201b90b", "53e9b5c2b7602d970410e685", "53e9ad4fb7602d9703734a56", "53e9bcbab7602d9704938708", "53e99e38b7602d97026fee78", "53e9a987b7602d97032e315a", "53e9bb6cb7602d97047ae341", "53e9b69eb7602d9704215779", "53e9ac43b7602d970361113a", "53e9ac28b7602d97035e8ed9", "53e9b815b7602d97043cd2ce", "53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc11b9", "53e9bc0ab7602d970486d078", "53e9a471b7602d9702d8c66e", "53e9bb4bb7602d970478ba53", "53e9a35fb7602d9702c6af6e", "53e99893b7602d97020caace", "53e9b661b7602d97041c0af9", "53e9ab2bb7602d97034b6a50", "53e999eeb7602d97022322cd", "53e9b403b7602d9703ef7479", "53e9ad18b7602d97036fc8b1", "53e99a91b7602d9702306555", "53e9baecb7602d970471bddc", "53e99fd0b7602d97028ad2f8", "53e9b8ccb7602d97044ac65d", "53e9a5e9b7602d9702f114cb", "53e9ac38b7602d97035fdbfa", "53e9bb02b7602d970473a833"]}

The early literature in the field was dominated by a sociological approach with Polsby's classic article on the US House of Representatives leading the way. In the late 70s and 80s, the sociological approach was supplanted by \u2018new institutionalism\u2019 which took its cue from the work of Coase (1937) and Williamson (1985). Economic driven models of institutionalization feature self-interested actors who, although constrained, behave rationally both in creating and maintaining institutions. In contrast, sociological models view actors as important but not conscious of the effects of their choices; thus, at any point in time institutions are the result both of intended and unintended actions. March's (1981, 1985) work has revised the sociological approach and dominates the international relations and historical institutional literature while the economic tradition persists in main- stream American political science."}

The local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk isconsidered with sufficient spatial resolution: the region from outside the Hillsphere to the Jovian radius is covered by the nested-grid method. Toinvestigate the thermal effects of the circumplanetary disk, various equationsof state are adopted. Large thermal energy around the protoplanet slightlychanges the structure of the circumplanetary disk. Compared with a modeladopting an isothermal equation of state, in a model with an adiabatic equationof state, the protoplanet's gas envelope extends farther, and a slightly thickdisk appears near the protoplanet. However, different equations of state do notaffect the acquisition process of angular momentum for the protoplanetarysystem. Thus, the specific angular momentum acquired by the system is fitted asa function only of the protoplanet's mass. A large fraction of the totalangular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. Thedisk forms only in a compact region in very close proximity to the protoplanet.Adapting the results to the solar system, the proto-Jupiter and Saturn havecompact disks in the region of r < 21 r_J (r < 0.028 r_HJ) and r < 66 r_S (r <0.061 r_HS), respectively, where r_J (r_HJ) and r_S (r_HS) are the Jovian andSaturnian (Hill) radius, respectively. The surface density has a peak in theseregions due to the balance between centrifugal force and gravity of theprotoplanet. The size of these disks corresponds well to the outermost orbit ofregular satellites around Jupiter and Saturn. Regular satellites may form insuch compact disks around proto-gas giant planets.", "references": ["53e9a92ab7602d970327b2e2", "53e9a0b5b7602d970299e40a", "53e9ace9b7602d97036c7239", "53e9b648b7602d97041a305b", "53e9ba84b7602d97046a88fb", "53e99e38b7602d97026fd214", "53e9b4eeb7602d97040175fd", "53e9ab6eb7602d970350c125", "53e9ac9bb7602d97036784b0", "53e9a089b7602d9702971bd5", "53e9af67b7602d97039a7a1e", "53e9bd18b7602d97049a3621", "53e9a1d5b7602d9702acd915", "53e9a7ebb7602d970312e450", "53e99915b7602d970214d731", "53e9b23ab7602d9703cd8280", "53e998fcb7602d9702137ee6", "53e9a4b8b7602d9702dd6457", "53e9b008b7602d9703a612e8", "53e9a7ebb7602d970312e451", "53e9ab48b7602d97034db753", "53e9bd18b7602d97049a234c", "53e9a2b2b7602d9702bbbaee", "53e9ae05b7602d9703811bc3", "53e9bd6fb7602d9704a0ca1c"]}

The follow-up times were 3, 6, 12, 36 or 48 weeks. The time-related and spatial characteristics of the cellular response were examined histomorphometrically using standardised sample fields under polarised-light microscopy. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear round cells were scarce in all follow-up groups. The occurrence of phagocytic cells (mononuclear macrophages and foreign-body giant cells) was highest in the PGA-fixed 12-week specimens. The giant cells seemed to adhere to the implant surface at an early stage, whereas the ultimate digestion and clearing of the decomposing polymeric material later on were performed by macrophages invading the implant body. No PGA was left in the 36-week specimens, while the gross geometry of the PLA screws was still intact at 48 weeks. In conclusion, the inflammatory response to these polymers was quite mild. Thus it seems probable that some other additional factors must influence the occurrence of the clinical inflammatory reactions.", "references": ["53e99d04b7602d97025b8c26", "53e9a945b7602d97032974ab", "53e9b75bb7602d97043004fc", "53e99a98b7602d97023104c3", "55a412da2401c6de3b80d21c", "53e99e71b7602d97027360c4", "53e99df7b7602d97026b9e80", "55a41c262401c6de3b82e394", "53e9b4dfb7602d97040024e4"]}

The hypothesis that breakage became a more important component of selection in the middle of the Mesozoic Era is supported by the finding that frequencies of breakage-induced shell repair increased from the Pennsylvanian and Triassic periods to the Cretaceous, Miocene, and Recent."}

First, the historical traffic flow data is obtained from the loop detectors installed on the road network of Beijing. Then, part of the data is selected for training the MARS model while the rest is used to test the method. The results based on MARS method are compared with those of other methods such as the Neural Networks. The proposed MARS method is proved to have a considerable accuracy. Moreover, the model constructed with MARS can be described with analytical functions, which helps a lot in the further research on traffic flow forecasting.", "references": ["53e9a94bb7602d970329e9c1", "56d8e4e5dabfae2eee2abda8", "53e9a508b7602d9702e2b802", "53e9b8f6b7602d97044dc1a6", "53e9bc4eb7602d97048c6a1d", "53e99a62b7602d97022d1842", "53e99d51b7602d970260acca", "53e9a618b7602d9702f4504e", "5488f3ec45ce471f90975de2", "558a88c384ae84d265be2c9d", "53e9ba11b7602d97046117d8", "53e9b95bb7602d9704549008", "53e9bd5ab7602d97049f44cf", "56d8508cdabfae2eeeff4e5e", "53e9a751b7602d9703088787"]}

By adding a suitable amount of V2O5 as additive, a semiconducting boundary layer is segregated at the grain boundaries after sintering in a reducing atmosphere. This layer dominates the temperature-dependent property and shows an NTCR effect with a thermistor constant of about 4200 K. Based on the microstructural and electrical properties, an n+-n-n+ energy band model is proposed for this boundary-layer thermistor.", "references": ["53e9a186b7602d9702a757af", "56d90abfdabfae2eee156407", "53e9aaecb7602d970346af67", "53e9bc32b7602d97048a1be0"]}
